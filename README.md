# Hashing & Salting Your Blog
## Objectives:
Transition your blog to use hashing/salting for password storage and authentication.
- This will entail making changes to:
    - The database (users table; need a column for the hash)
    - The verification callback in the local strategy setup code
    - Any place where you create a user from code (hash/salt the plain-text password, and store the resulting value in the row in the database)
